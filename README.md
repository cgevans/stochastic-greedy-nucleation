This is an implementation of the stochastic greedy model of nucleation,
and related models, originally described in [Evans et al,
2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06890-z) [^1]. The repository
includes both the original Julia code, and a Rust reimplementation that
can also be used as a Python module. Much of the Rust code was generated
with heavy use of LLM-based translation, and needs review.
